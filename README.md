# The product
LOOPABLE is a platform that promotes the circular economy and environmental sustainability with the rental of objects between private individuals. Users reduce the environmental impact of the production of goods intended for little use, earning through the rental of the objects they own. It allows responsible management of resources and the reduction of waste, contributing to a more sustainable future.
